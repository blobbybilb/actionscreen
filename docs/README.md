_Note: This is currently in alpha, and lacking many of the features I hope to implement. But it works._

### Installation (?)
The simplest way to use actionscreen (in its current alpha form) is by downloading this repository,
adding things into your config file, and running the python file. This requires you to have
Python 3.6+ installed.

### How to use
1. Run the serverapp.py file on your computer where you want to run the actions.
(make sure to give accessibility permission on macOS if not running with sudo)
2. Open the web app on your tablet/device which you want to trigger actions with.
